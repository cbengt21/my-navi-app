Ways Reference Nodes by ID
OSM ways do not contain coordinates; they only reference node IDs.
Example from an .osm file:
<way id="123">
    <nd ref="1001"/>
    <nd ref="1002"/>
    <nd ref="1003"/>
    <tag k="highway" v="primary"/>
</way>

Nodes Are Defined Separately
Example node definitions:
<node id="1001" lat="52.1" lon="13.4"/>
<node id="1002" lat="52.2" lon="13.5"/>
<node id="1003" lat="52.3" lon="13.6"/>
